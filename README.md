# vi_sioyek

User configuration files for sioyek

Features:
  - Vi like navigation commands (just like in Zathura PDF).
  
Comming in the future:
  - Script that automatically installs Sioyek and sets up the user config files.

How to use:
  - Just run the script.

Legal notice:
  - This is just a costumization of the Sioyek project config files in order to get a more vi-like enviroment. I don't own or am in anyway related to the Sioyek project development.
