# vi_sioyek

User configuration files for sioyek

Features:
  - Vi like navigation commands (just like in Zathura PDF).
  
Comming in the future:
  - Script that automatically installs Sioyek and sets up the user config files.

How to use:
  - Just copy the configuration files to where your original user config files are (not your normal config files). If you have any doubts about how to do this go check the Sioyek Project.
  - Also don't forget to copy my tutorial.pdf to overwritte tutorail.pdf, if you don't know where this file is after the instalation try the following command: find / -name tutorial.pdf

Legal notice:
  - This is just a costumization of the Sioyek project config files in order to get a more vi-like enviroment. I don't own or am in anyway related to the Sioyek project development.
